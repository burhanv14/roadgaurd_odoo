# ✅ Calendar Mock Data Implementation - COMPLETE!

## What Was Added

### 🎯 **Rich Mock Calendar Data**

The calendar now displays comprehensive mock service request data when no backend authentication is available:

### 📅 **Sample Events Include:**

1. **Today's Events**:
   - **9:00 AM - Oil Change (Toyota Camry)** - In Progress, Medium Priority
   - **2:00 PM - Brake Repair (Honda Civic)** - Pending, High Priority

2. **Tomorrow's Events**:
   - **8:30 AM - Engine Diagnostic (Ford F-150)** - Assigned, Urgent Priority

3. **Day After Tomorrow**:
   - **10:00 AM - Tire Replacement (BMW X5)** - Pending, Medium Priority

4. **Yesterday (Completed)**:
   - **11:00 AM - Battery Replacement (Nissan Altima)** - Completed, High Priority

### 🔧 **Service Types Demonstrated**:
- Oil Change
- Brake Service
- Engine Repair/Diagnostic
- Tire Service
- Electrical Service (Battery)

### 👥 **Customer Information**:
- Full customer names and contact details
- Professional email addresses
- Formatted phone numbers
- Realistic service locations

### 🎨 **Visual Features**:
- **Color-coded priorities**: Red (urgent), Orange (high), Yellow (medium), Green (low)
- **Status indicators**: Different styling for pending, in-progress, completed
- **Time display**: Proper scheduling with start/end times
- **Professional layout**: Clean, responsive calendar grid

## How It Works

### 🔄 **Automatic Fallback**:
```typescript
// When no authentication token is found:
if (!token) {
  console.warn('No authentication token found, showing mock calendar data');
  return this.getMockCalendarData(); // ← Shows rich mock data
}

// When API calls fail:
catch (error) {
  console.error('Error fetching calendar data from backend:', error);
  return this.getMockCalendarData(); // ← Graceful fallback
}
```
